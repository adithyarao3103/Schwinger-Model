# Numerical simulation of $U(1)$ Wilson Lattice Gauge Model - The Schwinger Model

In this repository, we present the numerical simulations of the Schwinger model, which is a $U(1)$ Wilson lattice gauge theory, by studying the dynamics of the spin-lattice model obtained by the Jordan-Wigner Transformation. 

We present both [real-time evolution](#real-time-dynamics) of particle density, entanglement entropy and electric fields for the vacuum of the Schwinger Model, and [variational quantum simulation](#variational-quantum-simulations) to obtain the ground state of the model for different mass parameters and observe the phase transitions in the model.  

Further, I am working on implementing a [PINN which can be trained to obtain the ground state of the system](#pinn-for-finding-the-ground-state). Preliminarily, I have obtained the phase transition as expected, but there are deviations from the expected values at positive bare masses.

## Real-Time Dynamics

[Jupyter Notebook](num_sim_schwinger.ipynb)

The numerical simulations of the real time dynamics is performed by both exact exponentiation of the Hamiltonian and Trotterization of the Hamiltonian. We present both the results below.

The theory and the experimental results are presented in the paper by Muschik et al.: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aa89ab

The results are as follows, and it can see that it matches the results in the paper.

## Variational Quantum Simulations

[Jupyter Notebook](vqe_gs_schwinger.ipynb)

Here, we variationally obtain the ground state of the Schwinger Model and calculate order parameters to observe phase transition as a function of bare mass of fermions of the theory. 

The experimental protocol and results are presented in the paper by Kokail et al.: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1177-4

### Gradient Calculation for optimization algorithm

> Please write to me if you find any error in the following analysis

We start with a random state as the initial state and we choose to rotate the state at each site by three angles $\theta_x$ $(R_x)$, $\theta_y$ $(R_y)$, & $\theta_z$ $(R_z)$

$$
R(\vec{\theta})= \left( \exp\left(\frac{i}{2} \sigma_x \theta_{x1} \right)\times \exp\left(\frac{i}{2} \sigma_y \theta_{y1} \right)\times \exp\left(\frac{i}{2} \sigma_z \theta_{z1} \right) \right) \otimes \cdots\otimes \left( \exp\left(\frac{i}{2} \sigma_x \theta_{xN} \right)\times \exp\left(\frac{i}{2} \sigma_y \theta_{yN} \right)\times \exp\left(\frac{i}{2} \sigma_z \theta_{zN} \right) \right)
$$

$$
\implies R(\vec\theta) = R_1(\vec\theta_1)\otimes R_2(\vec\theta_2) \otimes \cdots\otimes R_N(\vec\theta_N)
$$

where $R_i$ denotes rotation matrix acting on site $i$, giving a parameterized state 

$$
|\psi(\vec\theta)\rangle = R(\vec\theta)|\psi_{\text{init}}\rangle
$$

In this case, the loss function which we want to minimize is the energy itself, therefore

$$
\mathrm{Loss} = L= \langle \psi(\vec\theta)| H | \psi(\vec\theta)\rangle = L= \langle \psi| R(\vec\theta)^\dagger H  R(\vec\theta)| \psi\rangle
$$

To minimize loss, we employ gradient descent method, in which we iteratively set

$$
\vec\theta = \vec\theta - \alpha {\frac{dL}{d\vec{\theta}}}
$$

with $\alpha$ being the learning rate.

The derivative of loss is given as 

$$
\frac{dL}{d\theta_i} = \langle \psi| \frac{dR(\vec\theta)^\dagger}{d\theta_i} H  R(\vec\theta)| \psi\rangle + \langle \psi| R(\vec\theta)^\dagger H  \frac{dR(\vec\theta)}{d\theta_i}| \psi\rangle
$$

The term $\displaystyle \frac{dR}{d\theta_i}$ can be calculated as 

$$
\frac{dR}{d\theta_{xi}} =
\cdots\otimes \left(\frac{d \exp((i/2)~\theta_{xi}\sigma_x)}{d\theta_{xi}}\times \exp((i/2)\theta_{yi}\sigma_y)\times \exp((i/2)\theta_{zi}\sigma_z)\right) \otimes \cdots
$$

which is equal to

$$
= \cdots\otimes \left( \frac{i}{2}\sigma_x\times \exp((i/2)~\theta_{xi}\sigma_x)\times \exp((i/2)\theta_{yi}\sigma_y)\times \exp((i/2)\theta_{zi}\sigma_z)\right) \otimes \cdots
$$

and similarly for $yi$ and $zi$

To calculate $\displaystyle \frac{dR^\dagger}{d\theta_i}$, use the fact that $(A\otimes B)^\dagger = A^\dagger \otimes B^\dagger$, giving

$$
R(\vec\theta)^\dagger = R_1(\vec\theta_1)^\dagger\otimes R_2(\vec\theta_2)^\dagger \otimes \cdots\otimes R_N(\vec\theta_N)^\dagger
$$

and therefore

$$
\frac{dR^\dagger}{d\theta_{xi}} =
\cdots\otimes \left(\frac{d \exp((i/2)~\theta_{xi}\sigma_x)}{d\theta_{xi}}\times \exp((i/2)\theta_{yi}\sigma_y)\times \exp((i/2)\theta_{zi}\sigma_z)\right)^\dagger \otimes \cdots
$$

which is equal to 

$$
= \cdots\otimes \left( \frac{i}{2}\sigma_x\times \exp((i/2)~\theta_{xi}\sigma_x)\times \exp((i/2)\theta_{yi}\sigma_y)\times \exp((i/2)\theta_{zi}\sigma_z)\right)^\dagger \otimes \cdots
$$

Therefore, we have 

$$
\frac{dR^\dagger}{d\theta_i} = \left( \frac{dR}{d\theta_i}  \right)^\dagger
$$

By iteratively obtaining the gradients and setting the $\theta\text{s}$ for the theory, we obtain the ground state of the Schwinger Model.

### Results

I have implemented, so far, the gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and adam optimizers, with cosine annealing and exponential learning rate schedulers. The results below are the results for adam optimizer with cosine annealed learning rate, and with injected noise.

The noise injection and cosine annealing of the learning rate is done so that the optimizer can visit a huge portion of the configuration space, and not get stuck in a local minima. 

> TODO #1: Quantify the error in the ground state energy and the angles.

> TODO #2: Stopping condition for the gradient descent has been set to `max(gradient) < 1e-5`. Verify if this stopping condition is sufficient.

> TODO #3: Even after implementing ADAM with injected noise and learning rate scheduling the obtained ground state energies does not match the exact ground state energy. Why?

The following are the results obtained. (`Exact` stands for values obtained from the exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian)

### Particle Density

![pd](gs_pd.png)

### Order Parameter

![op](gs_op.png)

We can see that there is a phase transition around $m_c \approx -0.7$ `(Byrnes, T., Sriganesh, P., Bursill, R. & Hamer, C. Density matrix renormalization  group approach to the massive Schwinger model. Nucl. Phys. B 109, 202â€“206  (2002). )`

We also see that for negative bare mass, it is energetically favourable to have particle excitations, which leads to non vanishing ground state particle density.

### Ground State Energy

![gs_energy](gs_energy.png)

We see that the ground state energy is symmetric around $m_c \approx -0.7$.

## PINN for finding the ground state

[Jupyter Notebook](PINN_schwinger-in_progress.ipynb)

The PINN takes as input the number $n \in \{1, 2, \cdots, 2^N\}$, indicating the basis $| n \rangle^\dagger = (0,0,\cdots,1_\text{at n}, \cdots, 0,0)$ and outputs the complex amplitude corresponding to the basis. 

The training is done by taking the expectation value of the hamiltonian as the loss function, to obtain the state where energy is minimum. 

> TODO #1: Fix the problem with convergence. Current model does not exactly converge, and still displays fluctuations even after large epochs. 

> TODO #2: Quantify the stopping condition. Current model runs the training loop without stopping at any condition. 

The approximate ground state particle densities obtained by this preliminary model is as follows:
